 # Stuff we need to do
 - [x] Communication with the nodes 
 - [x] Sniper to be functional
 - [x] Popup for IP and token
 - [x] UI fixes like closing popups etc
 - [x] Displaying logs dynamically
 - [x] Sending data from sniper to host whilst updating the config files to display updated info on-site.
 - [ ] Maybe? a function to actively remove html code from the site instead of refreshing.
 - [ ] Syncing settings with host and nodes to the webui
 - [ ] Settings UI page
 - [ ] Removing accounts and tasks from the web ui
