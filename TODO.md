 # Stuff we need to do
 - [ ] Communication with the nodes 
 - [ ] Sniper to be functional
 - [ ] Popup for IP and token
 - [ ] UI fixes like closing popups etc
 - [ ] Removing accounts and tasks from the web ui
 - [ ] Displaying logs dynamically
 - [ ] Sending data from sniper to host whilst updating the config files to display updated info on-site.
 - [ ] Maybe? a function to actively remove html code from the site instead of refreshing.
 - [ ] Syncing settings with host and nodes to the webui
 - [ ] Settings UI page
