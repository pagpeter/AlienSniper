# Packets

Packets are send between the nodes and the host, later also between the web dashboard and the host.
They are send over a websocket connection.

Packets are encoded like this:
```json
{
    "type": <type>
    "content": {

    }
} 
```

There are different types of packets: 

### Auth

The `auth` packet is the first package that is being send by the node/web.
The secret key is a token generated by the host, that is needed for any device that wants to connect.

content:
```json
{
    "key": <secret key>
}
```

### Config

The `config` packet is normally send from the host to the client.

content:
```json
{
    TODO
}
```
